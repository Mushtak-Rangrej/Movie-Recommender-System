# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

An interactive **Movie Recommender Web App** built with **Python** and **Streamlit** that suggests movies based on your favorite selection using a **content-based filtering** approach.

This app uses data from the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset and provides movie posters via the TMDb API.

⚙️ How It Works
Loads a precomputed similarity matrix using cosine similarity based on textual features like genres, keywords, cast, etc.

Displays a dropdown menu of available movies.

On selection, shows the top 5 most similar movies with poster images fetched dynamically from TMDb API.

🔑 API Key Info
To use the TMDb API (for fetching posters), an API key is embedded in the code:
